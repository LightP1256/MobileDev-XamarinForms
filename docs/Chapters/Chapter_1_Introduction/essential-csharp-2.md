# Essential C# Part 2
This section is intended to be a quick refresher one more of the C# syntax we will encounter in subsequent sections. 
Like before, it is not a comprehensive treatment of C#.

In this section, all the code will be targeting a console application.
You can use either Visual Studio 2019 or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

- Visual Studio 2019. Create a new project, and search on "Console". From the results pick Console App (.NET Core)
- Visual Studio Code. [See these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code) to create and debug an console application.

I will use Visual Studio 2019 for Windows for the sake of consistency (as it's what we use in our teaching labs).
