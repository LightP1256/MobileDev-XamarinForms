# First Exploration in Xamarin Forms
This section is intended to familiarise you with the tools and to demonstrate some of the key concepts.
The first task is to create a blank forms app.

- For the Mac, [follow this link](create-project-mac.md)
- For Windows, [follow this link](create-project-pc.md)

Before you try and run anything, take some time to explore these projects. There are some important points to note:

- A Solution is a collection of projects
- A Forms Solution is actually two apps (one for iOS and the other for Android) and one shared library (the Forms project)
- The entry point of each is a Native App - each instantiates Forms code to create the UI etc.
- Each constituent project within the solution has it's own settings, so the Android project has distinct settings to iOS.

From this point, where the similarities are obvious, Visual Studio (VS)) for Mac screenshots will be the default. VS Screenshots for Windows will be included if needed.
