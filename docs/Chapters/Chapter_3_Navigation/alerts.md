# Alerts and Pop-Ups
Xamarin.Forms provides a very simple set of APIs for pop-ups and alerts

First, you should make yourself familiar with the [Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/pop-ups)

The APIs are fairly simple and the documentation is very comprehensive, so we will not focus on that aspect. The documentation covers three basic types of popup via three methods:

* `DisplayAlert` 
* `DisplayActionSheet`
* `DisplayPromptAsync`

It is important to understand that these are all methods on the [`Page` class](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/xamarin.forms.page?view=xamarin-forms).

> The built-in pop-ups APIs are all **View Based**

We will look at how you might invoke these from a view model. This was briefly covered before in an earlier chapter, but it is good to look at this again.
