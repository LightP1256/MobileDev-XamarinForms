# Simple `TableView` Example
The example code is found in the [/code/Chapter4/TableView](/code/Chapter4/TableView) folder.

> * Build and run the code
> * Click on a row
> * Familiarize yourself with the code

You might be relieved to know that `TableView` is a lot simpler than `ListView`. This is because it is static and not fed with a source of data. The equivalent of `TableView` is seen in many places, such as a phone settings application, in effect being used as a means to layout data in rows.
