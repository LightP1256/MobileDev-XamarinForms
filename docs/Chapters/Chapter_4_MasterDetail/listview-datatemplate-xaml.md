# Data templates and Menu Items in XAML

The example for this section is found in the [/code/Chapter4/ListView/G_SimpleListView_Datatemplate_XAML](/code/Chapter4/ListView/G_SimpleListView_Datatemplate_XAML) folder.

> * Build and run the code
> * Click on a row to add an additional row
> * Swipe a cell left and click delete
> * Familiarize yourself with the code, noting the changes in the code-behind

In the previous section, quite a lot of code was written to specify which cell should be used, a menu item to allow data to be deleted and a command for invoking code on the ViewModel.

In this section, much of that boiler-plate code is removed and replaced with XAML.
