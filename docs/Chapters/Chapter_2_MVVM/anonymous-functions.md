# Anonymous Methods and Lambda
[C# has a bit of a history](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/anonymous-functions#the-evolution-of-delegates-in-c) when it comes to anonymous functions and lambdas. You may have heard the terms `Action`, `Delegate`, `Anonymous Function`, `Func`, `Lambda` or `Closure`. You may encounter any of these terms and it can be quite confusing. As C# evolved, new syntax was introduced to help code become more expressive and concise. The older syntax was kept for backwards compatibility.

## Delegates (C# v1)
From the Microsoft documentation:

> A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type. 

Source: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates/index



## Delegates (C# v2)
From the Microsoft documentation:

> C# version 2.0 introduced the concept of anonymous methods, which allow code blocks to be passed as parameters in place of a separately defined method. 

Source: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates/index

## Delegates and Lambdas expressions (C# v3)
From the Microsoft documentation:

> C# 3.0 introduced lambda expressions as a more concise way of writing inline code blocks. Both anonymous methods and lambda expressions (in certain contexts) are compiled to delegate types. Together, these features are now known as anonymous functions. For more information about lambda expressions, see [Lambda expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions).

## Lambdas
Lambda expressions tend to be the most concise and expressive form. 



## Action

## Func
